# Privacy policy

*Last updated: April 23, 2025*

The privacy of your data—and it is your data, not ours!—is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy is split into sections. For your convenience, links to each of those sections is as follows:

* [Privacy policy](#privacy-policy)
* [What we collect and why](#what-we-collect-and-why)
* [When we access or disclose your information](#when-we-access-or-disclose-your-information)
* [Your rights with respect to your information](#your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information)
* [How we secure your data](#how-we-secure-your-data)
* [Data retention](#data-retention)
* [Location of site and data](#location-of-site-and-data)

This policy applies to TekMute, built and maintained by TekCastPork.

This policy applies to our handling of information about users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with TekMute). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

* **Your Discord Identity**. We collect a token from Discord (operated by Discord Inc) using their published API services in order to perform actions on your behalf. We do not receive anything else from Discord. This token is automatically revoked (made invalid) upon closing TekMute.

### Identity and access

When you launch TekMute, it connects to Discord via Discord's published API mechanisms. TekMute will use these API mechanisms to authenticate as you on your behalf in order to provide its primary functions.

We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you email TekCastPork with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.

## When we access or disclose your information

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. We use Discord to run our applications and provide services to you. You can view Discord's Privacy Policy [here](https://discord.com/privacy)

TekCastPork doesn't look at your content except for limited purposes with your express permission, for example, if an error occurs that stops TekMute from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases, and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them recurring.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

## Your rights with respect to your information

I strive to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using TekMute services because our applications may then no longer work.
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Depending on applicable law, you may have the right to appeal our decision to deny your request, if applicable. We will provide information about how to exercise that right in our response denying the request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in the EU or UK, you can contact your data protection authority to file a complaint or learn more about local privacy laws.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our service to Discord.


## Data retention

We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. In the case of TekMute, this is only while the program is executing. Once the program is closed, any retained data is forgotten.

## Location of site and data

TekMute operates using Discord's API services, which may transfer data to the United States. If you are located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using TekMute, you consent to this transfer.
