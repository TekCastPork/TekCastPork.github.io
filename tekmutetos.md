# Terms of Service

*Last updated: April 23, 2025*

From myself, I thank you for using our TekMute! We built it to help you do your best work. Because we don’t know every one of our users personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to **TekCastPork**.

When we say “Services”, we mean **TekMute**, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that use our Services.

We may update these Terms of Service ("Terms") in the future. You can track all changes made since mid-2018 [here](https://tekcastpork.github.io/tekmute/terms). Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision. **These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

## Usage of our Services
My using our Services, we provide to you a worldwide, royalty-free,  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Service. This license specifically is a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 license. See [the following](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) for exact details. A copy of this license is also provided with the Service.

## Termination

As our Services is a piece of free-to-use software with no first-party account requirements, these terms do not have a termination clause, as there is nothing to terminate. To terminate the terms, you simply just stop using our Services.


## Uptime and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services but do take uptime of our applications seriously.
2. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that we may process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://tekcastpork.github.io/tekmute/privacy) and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:
  - **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to improve our Services. We can only look at logs and metadata you send us however, there is no automated reporting system.
3. Our Services connect to the third-party service Discord, operated by Discord Inc. as part of its primary functions. By using our Services, you must have an account with Discord and agree to thir Terms and Conditions, as well as applicable privacy policies.
4. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), we are a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms and the [Privacy policy](https://tekcastpork.github.io/tekmute/privacy). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use our Services in a way that violates the regulations.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the Service without express written permission from the Company. 
2. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.

## Features and Bugs

We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.

If you have a question about any of these Terms, please contact TekCastPork on Discord.
